WordPress Tools
=
This is a collection of tools for WordPress development. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I convert my bash scripts to javascript.

## Installation
```
npm install -g procyon-wordpress-tools
```

Or check out the repo and run the following command from the root directory:
`npm install -g`

During development you can use npm link to test your changes without installing.
